# highlighter
heavily modified version of prism.js

noted improvements:
- support for Svelte
- closely ressembles VScode editor syntax highlighting
- defaults to Monokai theme (pretty)


any npm package stemming from @byjackli are not designed with open-source in mind. this means that documentation is the lowest priority, but it doesn't mean that it is not maintained. all pull requests will be reviewed, but feel free to fork or message me about elevating this project into a full-fledged package.
